### About Me
---

🌱 Hi, I’m Yuffie Hu

👀 I’m a Full-stack Software Developer passionate about teamwork and producing scalable & accessible web appplications.

🗓 Currently working on an Agile team of 10 to pilot a fully viable web app solution to act as an educational/canonical project for our client, Practicum by Yandex

👯‍♂️ Learning more collaborative skills from The Collab Lab while building [a smart shopping list app](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-46-smart-shopping-list). 

💼 [My first project](https://github.com/yuff1006/Music-Therapy-Documentation.git) was a web app using MySQL, Python, Flask and Javascript automating Therapy Documentation process at my company. It is fully functional and saving much time in my workflow. I plan to keep updating and adding features to it. 

💞️ My first international Hackathon was a blast. Check out our [full-stack web app](https://100daysoflove.netlify.app/)
