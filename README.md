- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuffie Hu
- 👀 I’m an aspiring software developer and currently going through Practicum by Yandex bootcamp focusing on frontend web development.
- 💞️ My first project was a web app using MySQL, Python, Flask and Javascript automating Therapy Documentation process at my company. It is fully functional and saving much time in my workflow. I plan to keep updating and adding features to it. https://github.com/yuff1006/Music-Therapy-Documentation.git
- 💼 My first international Hackathon was a blast. Check out our full-stack web app: https://100daysoflove.netlify.app/
